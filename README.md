# Code-Learning
This repository is a collection of programs written by me as I learn more about programming. Some of the languages programs will be written in include Python, Java, and C++.

This collection will be organized through various coding exercises done in  multiple languages. 

An example is Pong. When written in Java, Python, and C++, they will appear in the Pong folder with the appopriate file names.
